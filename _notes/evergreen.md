Don't build a pile of dissociated notes. They won’t have added up to anything. To form connections across topics and contexts. 
create notes which are only about 1 thing that capture it entirety as much as possible.

Your notes should be concept-oriented to discover connections across [books](/books), [domains]- As you update and link to the note over time,  ]To makes you think expansively about what other concepts might be related, add lots of links between your notes. 

The Evergreen concept evolves largely from Niklas Luhmann’s [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) who wrote 70 books in his life time. Andy Matuschak proposed the term Evergreen Notes to describe system of note-taking that helps to accumulate insights [- aspires towards cumulative personal knowledge], rather than simply information capture.

Such notes are mean for your own consumption or to seek further inputs.
