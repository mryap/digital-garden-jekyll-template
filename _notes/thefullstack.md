The *Full Stack* term originates from system development, where front and backend 
are traditionally separate from each other. 

People who work in both are often referred to as “Full Stack Developers”, since their skills and experience span across the whole tech stack. 

I also find this term quite adequate for my current situation, where I cover all things Analytics. 
Therefore, this is how I call myself: Full Stack Analyst.

Full Stack Analyst is my catch all-phrase that I comes up with to describe who I am, what I do and what I can bring to the table. 

My career started out as a webmaster/web designer I’ve built desktop applications, websites, and apps as a freelancer. This is where I learned about project and demand management, handling stakeholders and building maintainable systems. But then I went to university and became a psychologist with courses in statistics, sql, machine leanring. Right after university I started working full time in Digital Analytics, which was always part of what I did as developer anyway. This was accompanied by Data Science techniques I learned to use. In my current job I also handle BI topics and far more strategical areas as Analytics Lead and only Senior Analyst of the company.

####  Conundrum

How would I call someone with that background, experience, and responsibilities? I build dashboards in analytics tool, but I am also the person explaining the developers what they need to implement and even supply them the source code and review what they have written. I maintain all tools like Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, some tag managers, or Adobe Target. For Data Science applications, I build the pipelines and automatic systems and keep them running. It is also me who comes up with the corporate data strategy, integrates all the systems and manage their vendors. To round things off, I manage my team and enable stakeholders to be as self-serviced as possible.

Titles like “Digital Analyst”, “Analytics Architect”, “Data Scientist” or “Data Analyst” would cut things a bit short. When I’m faced with a business challenge, I bring all things from above to the table to provide the best solution possible, being end-to-end responsible for both the outcome and the process. This is a situation commonly found in organizations with a small team, but also some small expert-departments in large corporates. Whenever people are forced to take over new tasks on top of their existing area of expertise, there is a chance for a Full Stack Expert being born.

Full Stack Analytics is not only what I do, but also what this blog is about. It covers both front- and backend of Analytics and marketing technology, as well as everything around it.
