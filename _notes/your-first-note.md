### Welcome!

The ‚ÄúFull Stack‚Äù term originates from system development, where front and backend are traditionally separate from each other. People who work in both are often referred to as ‚ÄúFull Stack Developers‚Äù, since their skills and experience span across the whole tech stack. While I worked as one myself, I also find this term quite adequate for my current situation, where I cover all things Analytics. Therefore, this is how I call myself: Full Stack Analyst.

You might be wondering: What exactly _is_ a Full Stack Analyst? It‚Äôs my catch all-phrase that I comes up with to describe who I am, what I do and what I can bring to the table. 

My career started out as a developer while I was still in school. I‚Äôve built desktop applications, websites, and apps as a freelancer. This is where I learned about project and demand management, handling stakeholders and building maintainable systems. But then I went to university and became a psychologist with courses in statistics, sql, machine leanring. Right after university I started working full time in Digital Analytics, which was always part of what I did as developer anyway. This was accompanied by Data Science techniques I learned to use. In my current job I also handle BI topics and far more strategical areas as Analytics Lead and only Senior Analyst of the company.

####  Conundrum

How would I call someone with that background, experience, and responsibilities? I build dashboards in analytics tool, but I am also the person explaining the developers what they need to implement and even supply them the source code and review what they have written. I maintain all tools like Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, some tag managers, or Adobe Target. For Data Science applications, I build the pipelines and automatic systems and keep them running. It is also me who comes up with the corporate data strategy, integrates all the systems and manage their vendors. To round things off, I manage my team and enable stakeholders to be as self-serviced as possible.

Titles like ‚ÄúDigital Analyst‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnalytics Architect‚Äù, ‚ÄúData Scientist‚Äù or ‚ÄúData Analyst‚Äù would cut things a bit short. When I‚Äôm faced with a business challenge, I bring all things from above to the table to provide the best solution possible, being end-to-end responsible for both the outcome and the process. This is a situation commonly found in organizations with a small team, but also some small expert-departments in large corporates. Whenever people are forced to take over new tasks on top of their existing area of expertise, there is a chance for a Full Stack Expert being born.

Full Stack Analytics is not only what I do, but also what this blog is about. It covers both front- and backend of Analytics and marketing technology, as well as everything around it.

### Link syntax

To link to another note, you can use regular [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for links, with a relative link to the other note, like this: [this is a link to a note about cats](/cats){: .internal-link}. Don't forget to use the `.internal-link` class to make sure the link is styled as an internal link.

Since the Web is all about HTML, you can always use plain HTML if you want, like this: <a class="internal-link" href="/cats">This is the same note about cats as above</a>.

Of course, you can also link to external websites, like this: [this is a link to Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/). Again, you can use plain HTML if you prefer.

Additionally, you can use Roam/wiki-style link syntax by wrapping a note's title in double brackets, like this: [[A note about cats]]. If the Roam-style link does not point to a valid note's title, the double brackets will still be shown, like this: [[There is no note with this title]].

### Automatic bi-directional links

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

### Link previews

If you're on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes: [[A note about cats]]

### Images

Finally, you can display images using Markdown syntax, like this:

![]({{page.image}})
