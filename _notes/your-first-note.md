### IS this a blog? Is this a Wiki?
 Itâ€™s a spot where I can post ideas, snippets, resources, thoughts, collections, and other bits and pieces that I find interesting and useful. 
 This is not a showcase and representative of what I can do. 
 The idea is about embracing the idea of curation, by me, for you.
