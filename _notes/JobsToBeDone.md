Jobs-to-be-done framework (JTBD) helps to identify user intent for a topic and define the right features. 

A “job,” in this case, is a micro task that’s connected to context—the circumstances in which the user is trying to get a job done. 

Jobs are agnostic to personality or preferences or demograhics.
