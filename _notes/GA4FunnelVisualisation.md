### Google Analytics 4 Funnel Visualisation
Want to see how many people saw at least one product (on the product page), then how many of them have added at least one product to a cart, and finally, how many of those did make a purchase?

Google Analytics 4 offers you a powerful new funnel visualisation tool that was previously only available in GA360 ($$$). This allows you to create a funnel visualisation with any kind of event, including impressions, clicks and pageviews.

No more URL-based funnels like in Universal Analytics (GA3)

Universal Analytics is going away in 1st July 2023. You should deploy GA4 in parallel without waiting, so you can get some data comparison next year after UA is inaccessible. Yes, if you haven’t started the process now, you’re late.
