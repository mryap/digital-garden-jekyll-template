Set Up Google Analytics with the following KPI’s and connected to Shopify.

Also need Shopify E-commerce Tracking from Google Analytics.

Google Analytics is already set up but not properly.

A lot of these KPI's are already set up probably and some might not be possible but I need as many as possible.

Sales & Turnover KPI’s:

• Sales: E-commerce retailers can monitor total sales by the hour, day, week, month, quarter, or year.

• Average order size:

• Gross profit: Calculate this KPI by subtracting the total cost of goods sold from total sales.

• Average margin: Average margin, or average profit margin, is a percentage that represents your profit margin over a period of time.

• Number of transactions: This is the total number of transactions. Use this KPI in conjunction with average order size or total number of site visitors for deeper insights.

• Conversion rate

• Shopping cart abandonment rate

• New customer orders vs. returning customer orders

• Cost of goods sold (COGS): COGS tells you how much you’re spending to sell a product. Not sure if it is possible to get this number with these metrics.

• Returns Rate: Percentage of orders returned. Very important for retail. I have a good return rate in comparison to the average I believe.

• Customer lifetime value (CLV): The CLV tells you how much a customer is worth to your business over the course of their relationship with your brand.

• Revenue per visitor (RPV): RPV gives you an average of how much a person spends during a single visit to your site. If this KPI is low, you can view website analytics to see how you can drive more online sales. Mostly one time visitors at this stage until my website takes over.

• Customer acquisition cost (CAC): CAC tells you how much your company spends on acquiring a new customer. This is measured by looking at your marketing spend and how it breaks down per individual customer.


Marketing KPI’s:

• Site traffic: Site traffic refers to the total number of visits to your ecommerce site.

• New visitors vs. returning visitors

• Time on site

• Bounce rate

• Pageviews per visit

• Average session duration

• Traffic source

• Mobile site traffic

• Day part monitoring: Looking at when site visitors come can tell you which are peak traffic times.

• Newsletter subscribers: The number of newsletter subscribers refers to how many users have opted into your email marketing list. I use Klavyio so can get this number quite easily.

• Subscriber growth rate: This tells you how quickly your subscriber list is growing. Pairing this KPI with the total number of subscribers will give you good insight into this channel. I use Klavyio so can get this number quite easily.

• Email open rate: This KPI tells you the percentage of subscribers that open your email. I use Klavyio so can get this number quite easily.

• Email click-through rate (CTR): While the open rate tells you the percentage of subscribers who open the email, the click-through rate tells you the percentage of those who actually clicked on a link after opening.

• Unsubscribes: You can look at both the total number and the rate of unsubscriptions for your email list. I use Klavyio so can get this number quite easily.

• Social followers and fans: Whether you’re on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, or Snapchat (or a combination of a few), the number of followers or fans you have is a useful KPI to gauge customer loyalty and brand awareness.

• Social media engagement: Social media engagement tells you how actively your followers and fans are interacting with your brand on social media.

• Clicks: The total number of clicks a link gets. You could measure this KPI almost anywhere: on your website, social media, email, display ads, PPC, etc.

• Average CTR: The average click-through rate tells you the percentage of users on a page (or asset) who click on a link.

• Average position: The average position KPI tells you about your site’s search engine optimization (SEO) and paid search performance.

• Pay-per-click (PPC) traffic volume: If you’re running PPC campaigns, this tells you how much traffic you’re successfully driving to your site.

• Number and quality of product reviews: Product reviews are great for a number of reasons: They provide social proof, they can help with SEO, and they give you valuable feedback for your business. I use a reviews company called Reviews.io so can get this number, when needed. Started two months ago so only 31 reviews so far.

• Affiliate performance rates: If you engage in affiliate marketing, this KPI will help you understand which channels are most successful.

• Net promoter score (NPS): I use a reviews company called Reviews.io so can get NPS fairly easily.

Budget is NOT negotiable, so only apply if you can do the job for the budget given.

Thank you
